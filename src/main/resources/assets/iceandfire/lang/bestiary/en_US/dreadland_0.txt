This place is completely devoid
of all life and instead filled
to the brim with undead legions
and ruins of some old empire.

It is a land of unyielding
cold that is locked
in perpetual darkness:
fires cannot burn there
for long, and no magic
can create a long-term blaze,
and it is locked in a state
of permanent deep-freeze.

Oddly enough in some places
it reminds me of
my own Overworld.




My torches will not be able
to be stay lit due to the
freezing cold of
the dimension,
and any water
or lava I pour
will immediatley solidify.

Ice dragon's freezing breath
will not do much good in
this already cold place,
and dragon fire is
too weakened by the
temperatures to be of
any meaningful use.
