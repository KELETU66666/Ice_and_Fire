While everything in Dreadlands
seems to be in ruins, there is
one particular structure
that towers over everything
and seems to be the most intact.

Being one of its kind, the Dread
Fortress is a colossal, very
fortificed structure that is both
a symbol of power and a
strongpoint for undead legions.

Furthermore, all the clues
lead to the very prominent
conclusion: this is also a
home fora Dread Queen.
It is only fitting that
this building withstands the
forces of time. Though, this

world harbors only one such
structure in existence.


Only the most brave, daring
and prepared adventurers should
venture into the place like that,
for its garrison will surely
not be pleased with the intrusion.
